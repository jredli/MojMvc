My try of making an MVC Php framework from scratch with help of internet.

* If you try to access a controller that doesn't exist, an error page will pop up.<br/>
* Config file with paths.<br/>
* It is possible to load views from controller now and pass arguments.<br/>
* Added bootstrap and jquery libraries.
